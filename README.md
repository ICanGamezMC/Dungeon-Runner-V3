# Project Dungeon Runner V3
This project is for a dungeon runner gamemode in minecraft java edition. the recent changes to minecrafts code allows for more complex functions in datapacking. 
A whole revamp of the code will be done as this datapack had several issues with updating to newer versions of minecraft beyond 1.21.5.
Support for custom armor, weapons, items, food, and blocks will be in this version as json files and structure blocks.

## Main Goals
* This Version hopefully brings more room to updating easier, more floors, and other promised features back in version 2. 
* New Better room generation will allow for more open concept like a 3D layout and more open floor plans.
* Running faster and multiplayer support with large server support soon.
* More readable code and more conditional code for less lag.
* New items and import ready dungeon rooms for people wanting to fork off this datapack and create new levels.

## Gamemode Design logic
We will have a item generator here to produce more standard items without spell errors. 
There will also be a key design for playablility and progression in this version, as the previous version you would only have access to one level. 
There will be beta testing to make sure players enjoy the datapack long after an update happens.


## Use of code
Publishing this code or compiling it without proper permision and without any code changes will result in a takedown request,
forking this code to develope new additions, more features, or your own twist with lots of content *( Not just one item )*
is permited to use this code when building off of it.
